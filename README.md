# Financial-Performance-Analysis-and-Forecasting

**Project Overview**
This project involved a comprehensive analysis of historical corporate financial data, the development of time-series models for future performance forecasting, and the construction of an interactive Business Intelligence (BI) dashboard. The goal was to transform raw financial statements into actionable insights, providing a clear visual representation of company performance and future projections for executive decision-making.

**•	Business Intelligence (BI):** Designing and developing user-friendly dashboards for complex data sets.

**•	Data Visualization:** Utilizing charts, graphs, and visual elements to communicate complex financial narratives effectively.

**•	Time Series Forecasting:** Applying statistical and machine learning models for financial projection.

---------


### **Tools & Technologies**

**•	Visualization & BI:** Power BI (Primary Dashboard Tool)

**•	Data Analysis & Modeling:** PowerBi >  Visualizations tab > Analytics tab > Forecast

**•	Data Processing:** CSV/Excel

**•	Dashboard Logic:** DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) in Power BI

---------


### **Methodology & Process**

**1.	Data Acquisition & Cleaning (ETL):** Ingested raw CSV financial data, handled missing values, and ensured consistency across time periods.

**2.	Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Performed initial analysis to understand data distribution, identify outliers, and define key performance indicators (KPIs).

**3.	Modeling:** Selected, trained, and validated time-series models (e.g., ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing) to generate quarterly forecasts.

**4.	Dashboard Development:** Designed a multi-page dashboard in Power BI, focusing on responsive design, calculated measures (DAX), and visual best practices.

**5.	Validation:** Compared model forecasts against historical data and calculated forecast accuracy metrics.
